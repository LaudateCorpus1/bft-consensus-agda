-- In this module, we (will) prove the two implementation obligations for the VotesOnce rule.  Note
-- that it is not yet 100% clear that the obligations are the best definitions to use.  See comments
-- in Concrete.VotesOnce.  We will want to prove these obligations for the fake/simple
-- implementation (or some variant on it) and streamline the proof before we proceed to tacke more
-- ambitious properties.
